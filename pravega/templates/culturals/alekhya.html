		<h2>Description for Alekhya-The Art event</h2>
		<p>
			Art is where imagination meets reality, where a soul expresses its emotions connecting fantasy and practicality. A playground for the thoughtful ideas of an artist, art, can transcend the barrier of human individuality and its essence and ethos inspire the combined spirit of humanity.

			Painting and designing are an integral part of art. Its clutches capture the attention of the audience and creator alike, defying the norms ruling the segregation of space and time. Here, in Alekhya, we give you a canvas, an opportunity to exhibit the artist in you, through a unique art competition, where you get to portray ideas through the colors of your soul. So, do not dallyâ€¦let your colors speak of your heart and become a part of this epic celebration.

		</p>
		<h2>Description for Alekhya-Decalcomania</h2>
		<p>
			That cool catchphrase, that hilarious quote or a completely new, amazing design of your own. Something from here, something there, all coming together to express something words never could.
			Alekhya brings you Decalcomania, the Poster Design Competition. Use any digital tool to create a poster based on the theme over a period of 7-days.
			A picture expresses a thousand words. Let your imagination and creativity make the next visual statement.
