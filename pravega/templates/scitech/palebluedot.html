		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
            We are human beings looking at the world around us through a human perspective. However, let us consider the possibility that there could be other beings like us – far, far away in the cosmos. How would they look at us? What would they think of our planet? Explore an outsider’s perspective of our own planet, "the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known", to quote Carl Sagan.<br>
            Join us in the novel journey to understanding our familiar planet from the point of view of an extra-terrestrial being, who tests your reasoning, knowledge, curiosity, creativity, and practical skills that could help you save your planet from extinction.<br>
            Explore the exciting aspects of the planet that you were unaware of, through an amazing journey that takes you through them step-by-step, with challenges awaiting you at each stage.<br>
            This journey is to be held at two levels:<br>
            Prelims: Solve a few problems to get a taste of problem-solving in Earth science using ideas from physics, chemistry, biology and so on.<br>
            Finals: Bring out the scientist in you- solve mysteries using logic and limited information to unveil exciting results, get hands-on experience in Earth Science labs.<br>

                <li>
                    Teams selected for finals will be notified through email, and the list will be uploaded on the website well ahead of the finals to allow participants from outside to plan their travel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finals will be held both offline and online. Top teams from Bangalore and outside will get a chance to visit IISc campus for an offline round. Teams from outside Bangalore that qualify prelims but cannot come to the campus for whatsoever reason can sit for an online final round.

                <li>
                    All answer submissions in online rounds must be made from the email ID’s submitted in the registration form. No mails from any other ID will be considered for evaluation (barring special cases).
